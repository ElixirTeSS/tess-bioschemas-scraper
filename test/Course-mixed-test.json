      "description": "# Overview\nThe workshop will focus on learning and internalizing the practices of unit testing, refactoring, and version control through hands-on experience. The first morning will start with an introduction into these concepts and tools used to support them. In the afternoon, we will transition to a *code clinic* and work together in small groups applying these practices to make improvements to **code brought by participants**. The second day will continue with the code clinic.\n\nThe focus of this course is not object-oriented programming, software architecture, design patterns or algorithms. The goal of this course is to introduce skills and techniques for effectively developing software.\n\n# Audience\nIf the answer to two or more of the following questions is “yes”, then this course is for you.\n<ul>\n<li>Do you write software to analyze data or implement in-silico models as part of your daily work?</li>\n<li>Do you write scientific publications based on software you created yourself but do not know what unit testing, refactoring or version control are?</li>\n<li>Are you writing code that you find hard to understand some weeks later?</li>\n<li>Do you have thousands of lines of code, but no automated way of verifying that the code works correctly?</li>\n<li>Do you find yourself regularly using “copy & paste” to re-use code you wrote earlier?</li>\n<li>Do small changes in your code later cause trouble in other unexpected places?</li>\n</ul>\n# Learning objectives\n<p>At the end of the workshop, the participants should be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>identify and avoid the most common mistakes in the process of writing software in a scientific context</li>\n<li>improve the quality of her/his code</li>\n<li>exploit techniques for effectively developing software</li>\n</ul>\n# Prerequisites\n##### Knowledge / competencies\n* Working knowledge of one of the following programming languages: R, python, C/C++, java, perl, Matlab.\n\n##### Technical / material\n* Participants will need <strong>send some extracts of their code at least 2 weeks before the course</strong>\n\n# Application\nThe registration fees for academics are **120 CHF** and **600 CHF** for for-profit companies.\n\nYou will be informed by email of your registration confirmation. Upon reception of the confirmation email, participants will be asked to confirm attendance by paying the fees within 5 days.\n\nDeadline for free-of-charge cancellation is set to **20/06/2021**.
