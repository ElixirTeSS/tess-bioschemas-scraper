Thank you for your understanding.**</span> -->\n# Overview\nWhile the statistical models and tools presented in an introductory statistics course (such as linear regression) can be used to answer a wide range of questions in life sciences, many types of data cannot be analyzed using these simple approaches.\n\nDuring this course, we will discuss statistical models and techniques beyond classical linear modelling. Following a brief review of the basics of linear regression, we will dive into more advanced topics, such as generalized and mixed-effects linear models. We will further discuss the application of mixed-effects linear models in analyzing longitudinal data. Finally, in an attempt to move beyond linearity, we will explore extensions of linear models, such as polynomial regression, splines, local regression, and generalized additive models. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be put on concrete applications in clinical and biological data analysis using real world examples.\n\n# Audience\nThis course is intended for life scientists who already use the R programming language and have some basic knowledge of statistics (including statistical tests, correlation, and linear models).\n\n# Learning outcomes\nAt the end of this course, participants will be able to:\n*  identify the appropriate model to analyze a dataset;\n*  fit the chosen model using R;\n*  assess the fit of the model, as well as its limitations.\n\n# Prerequisites\n##### Knowledge / competencies\nThe course is intended for people already **familiar with basic statistics and R**. Participants must be comfortable with topics such as hypothesis testing, correlation and linear models, and must have a **prior knowledge of the \"R\" language and environment for statistical computing and graphics**. Participants who have already followed the SIB course [\"Introduction to statistics with R\"](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/2021-02-intro-stats) or an equivalent course, and have used its content in practice should fit this prerequisite.  \n\n<span style=\"color: black;\">**Before applying to this course, please self-assess your knowledge in stats and R to make sure this course is right for you.

Thank you for your understanding. </span>**\n# Overview\nReproducible analysis in bioinformatics goes beyond good documentation and sharing code. Often, analyses depend on an entire environment with many different programs, libraries and settings. For the sake of reproducibility, but also for productivity, you might want to store, reuse, and share your environments using container software such as Docker and Singularity. Containerization is a lightweight and scalable way of working with such isolated environments. For example, with Docker you can develop, store and manage environments based on Linux operating systems which can run in mostly any computer. \n\nOften, bioinformatic calculations also require large memory and CPU resources, therefore you might want to use a shared computer environment (e.g. a HPC cluster). However, to run Docker you need to have privileged rights (i.e. as root), which is not the case for Singularity, a program that enables you to run environments from a wide range of resources (including Docker) in a safe manner without the need for privileged access. Combining Singularity and Docker thus makes you extremely flexible in how, when and where you use your computer environments and those of others. \n\nTo introduce you to working with containers in the context of bioinformatics research, we will take a practical approach with several hands-on exercises to go through the basics of using, developing and sharing containers.\n\nThe course materials can be found in the dedicated [GitHub page](https://sib-swiss.github.io/containers-introduction-training/latest/).\n# Audience\nThis course is addressed to bioinformaticians and life scientists that are doing bioinformatic analyses and want to get introduced to containers.\n\n# Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the participants are expected to:\n* Understand the basic concepts and terminology associated with virtualization with containers\n* Customize, store, manage and share containerized environments with Docker\n* Describe and understand the essential differences between Docker and Singularity\n* Use Singularity to run containers on a shared computer environment (e.g. a HPC cluster)\n\n# Prerequisites\n##### Knowledge / competencies\nThis course is designed for those interested to work with containers in the context of bioinformatics. Practical experience on the basic UNIX commands is required. You can test your skills with Unix with the quiz [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2BEWeOKLbIRGBT_aDEGPce1FOaVYBbhBiaqcaHoBKNB27MQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you do not feel comfortable with UNIX commands, you can refresh your knowledge with our [Unix fundamentals](https://edu.sib.swiss/course/view.php?name=UNIX_I) e-learning module.\n\n##### Technical\nYou are required to bring your own laptop with [Docker pre-installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and have created an account on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/). Note that you need admin rights in your computer to install and use Docker. In addition, Windows users require a recent version of [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). \n\n# Schedule \nThe schedule and course materials are in the dedicated [GitHub page]( https://sib-swiss.github.io/containers-introduction-training/latest/course_schedule/\n ).\n# Application\n**<span style=\"color: red;\">This course is now full with a long waiting list.</span>**\n\nSIB courses usually open for applications 1-2 months before the course takes place.

Since most of their implementations are directly linked to databases that annotate the function of genes in the cell, the course will also introduce GO enrichment analysis.\n\n\n# Audience\nBiologists eager to identify a statistically reliable set of genes that are differentially expressed.\n\n# Learning objectives\nAt the end of the course, the participants will be able to:\n*  identify statistical methods that could be used to pinpoint differentially expressed genes quantified by methods such as microarrays or RNA sequencing\n*  determine whether a set of genes shows statistically significant differences between two classes or not\n*  distinguish available enrichment analysis methods\n*  apply GSEA using R\n*  apply enrichment analysis implementations using R\n*  determine whether the genes of a GO term have a statistically significant difference in expression or not\n*  learn where to find other gene sets in databases (e.g. KEGG, oncogenic gene sets) and use them in R.   \n\n\n# Prerequisites\n*Knowledge / Competencies*\n* statistics beginner level (T-test, multiple testing methods). \n* R beginner level (Rstudio, install a library, matrix manipulation, read files).

Python to the rescue!\n\nPython is an open-source and general-purpose scripting language which runs on all major operating systems. It was designed to be easily read and written with comparatively simple syntax, and is thus a good choice for beginners in programming. Python is applied in many disciplines and is one of the most common languages for bioinformatics. The Python community enthusiastically maintains a rich collection of libraries/modules for everything from web development to machine learning. Other programming languages such as R have comparable functionality to Python, however some tasks are more natural (and easier!) in Python.\n\nIn this course, participants will learn the basic concepts and data structures necessary to solve routine data manipulation tasks. Importantly, we will cover the concepts, terminology, and approach to documentation required to further develop skills in Python programming independently. The goal is to take control of your research questions in an independent manner.\n\nTopics include:\n\n* A basic introduction to Python scripting and computing in general\n* Creating, populating, and modifying data structures\n* Working with files : reading / writing\n* Installing / Importing libraries/modules\n* Writing functions\n* Best practices in Python programming\n* Debugging and documentation\n\n# Audience\nThis 3-day course is addressed to **beginners** who want to become familiar with writing Python code to accomplish common tasks such as automated data parsing, basic statistical operations and graphical representations.\n\nFor people who are proficient in programming: this course might be on the **slow side** for you and an intermediate python class is recommended (check regularly our upcoming training courses).\n\n# Learning objectives\n\nBy the end of this course, you will not only be prepared to learn more advanced bioinformatics-specific applications in forthcoming courses, but also be able to:\n\n* Create, populate, and modify data structures\n* Work with files: read and write files\n* Install and import libraries and modules\n* Write functions\n* Apply best practices in Python programming\n* Debug and document your own code\n\n# Prerequisites\n### Knowledge / competencies\nThis course is designed for beginners; there is no requirement for previous training in Python. However, we encourage completion of our \"First Steps with UNIX\" course or our <a href=\"https://edu.sib.swiss/course/view.php?id=82\" target=\"_blank\">“UNIX Fundamentals”</a> tutorial. Basic concepts of algorithmics is a plus.\n### Technical\nYou are required to have your own laptop. We will be working with Python managed by <a href=\"https://docs.continuum.io\" target=\"_blank\">Anaconda</a> - a free and operating system (OS)-agnostic platform for organizing Python libraries and environments. It is bundled with Anaconda Navigator, a graphical user interface which will help ease you into what Python makes possible. We will discuss in detail what all of this precisely means during the course. In preparation, all you have to do is <a href=\"https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install\" target=\"_blank\">download and install Anaconda for your particular OS</a>. Use any most recent version of Python (>=  3.7). If your disk space is limited, you can install <a href=\"https://conda.io/miniconda.html\" target=\"_blank\">Miniconda </a>instead. However this lacks the Anaconda Navigator GUI and many of the packages distributed with Anaconda.\n\nWe will also be interacting with python via the jupyter notebook interface and we ask that you <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/install\" target=\"_blank\">install jupyter notebook</a>, via conda.\n\n\n# Application\n<!--<span style=\"color: red;\">**This course is now full. From now on, any new application will be placed into the waiting list and participants will only be contacted if a place become available.**</span>-->\n <span style=\"color: red;\">**Application is closed.**</span>\n\nRegistration fees are **180 CHF** for academics and **900 CHF** for for-profit companies. \n\nYou will be informed by email of your registration confirmation. Upon reception of the confirmation email, participants will be asked to confirm attendance by paying the fees within 5 days.\n\nApplications will close as soon as the places will be filled up. While participants are registered on a first come, first serve basis, exceptions may be made to ensure diversity and equity. Deadline for free-of-charge cancellation is set to **20/02/2022**. Cancellation after this date will not be reimbursed. Please note that participation to SIB courses is subject to our [general conditions](http://www.sib.swiss/training/terms-and-conditions).\n\n# Venue and Time\nThis course will be streamed online.\n\nIt will start at 9:00 and end around 17:00. \n\nPrecise information will be provided to the participants in due time.\n\n#  Additional information\nCoordination: Diana Marek\n\nWe will recommend 0.75 ECTS credits for this course (given a passed exam at the end of the course).\n\nYou are welcome to register to the SIB courses mailing list to be informed of all future courses and workshops, as well as all important deadlines using the form [here](https://lists.sib.swiss/mailman/listinfo/courses).\n\nPlease note that participation in SIB courses is subject to our [general conditions](http://www.sib.swiss/training/terms-and-conditions).\n\nSIB abides by the [ELIXIR Code of Conduct](https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct).

Python to the rescue!\n\nPython is an open-source and general-purpose scripting language which runs on all major operating systems. It was designed to be easily read and written with comparatively simple syntax, and is thus a good choice for beginners in programming. Python is applied in many disciplines and is one of the most common languages for bioinformatics. The Python community enthusiastically maintains a rich collection of libraries/modules for everything from web development to machine learning. Other programming languages such as R have comparable functionality to Python, however some tasks are more natural (and easier!) in Python.\n\nIn this course, participants will learn the basic concepts and data structures necessary to solve routine data manipulation tasks. Importantly, we will cover the concepts, terminology, and approach to documentation required to further develop skills in Python programming independently. The goal is to take control of your research questions in an independent manner.\n\nTopics include:\n\n* A basic introduction to Python scripting and computing in general\n* Creating, populating, and modifying data structures\n* Working with files : reading / writing\n* Installing / Importing libraries/modules\n* Writing functions\n* Best practices in Python programming\n* Debugging and documentation\n\n# Audience\nThis 3-day course is addressed to **beginners** who want to become familiar with writing Python code to accomplish common tasks such as automated data parsing, basic statistical operations and graphical representations.\n\nFor people who are proficient in programming: this course might be on the **slow side** for you and an intermediate python class is recommended (check regularly our upcoming training courses).\n\n# Learning objectives\n\nBy the end of this course, you will not only be prepared to learn more advanced bioinformatics-specific applications in forthcoming courses, but also be able to:\n\n* Create, populate, and modify data structures\n* Work with files: read and write files\n* Install and import libraries and modules\n* Write functions\n* Apply best practices in Python programming\n* Debug and document your own code\n\n# Prerequisites\n### Knowledge / competencies\nThis course is designed for beginners; there is no requirement for previous training in Python. However, we encourage completion of our \"First Steps with UNIX\" course or our <a href=\"https://edu.sib.swiss/course/view.php?id=82\" target=\"_blank\">“UNIX Fundamentals”</a> tutorial. Basic concepts of algorithmics is a plus.\n### Technical\nYou are required to have your own laptop. We will be working with Python managed by <a href=\"https://docs.continuum.io\" target=\"_blank\">Anaconda</a> - a free and operating system (OS)-agnostic platform for organizing Python libraries and environments. It is bundled with Anaconda Navigator, a graphical user interface which will help ease you into what Python makes possible. We will discuss in detail what all of this precisely means during the course. In preparation, all you have to do is <a href=\"https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install\" target=\"_blank\">download and install Anaconda for your particular OS</a>.

Registered participants will receive information from the course organizer in due time.**</span>\n\n# Overview\nUsing high-throughput technologies, you can identify long lists of candidate genes that differ between two experimental conditions. In order to interpret these gene lists and to discover fundamental properties like gene function and disease relevance, you need to use the annotation linked to a given gene or protein sequence.\n\nThe goals of this course and the practical exercises that follow are to give some basic theoretical and practical knowledge on protein sequence databases with a focus on [UniProtKB](https://www.uniprot.org/), on the different manual and automated annotation pipelines (such as [HAMAP](https://hamap.expasy.org/)) and, in particular, on the optimum use of UniProtKB. UniProtKB and HAMAP are SIB resources; they are listed in [Expasy](https://www.expasy.org/), the Swiss Bioinformatics Portal.During the theory and the practical sessions, we will discuss questions such as:\n* Where do the protein sequences come from?\n* What are the differences between the major protein sequence databases?\n* What are the manual and automated gene / protein annotation pipelines?\n* What are the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation pipelines?\n* How to assess protein sequence accuracy and annotation quality?\n* How to extract biological knowledge from a Blast result or gene list?\n\n# Audience\nThis course targets biologists and bioinformaticians who seek to analyze protein data. It will also be useful to programmers and data scientists, be they from academia or industry, who programmatically access protein sequence databases and need to understand the data.\n\n# Learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the participants are expected to:\n* list the differences between the major protein sequence databases\n* describe the major protein sequence and GO annotation pipelines\n* assess the accuracy of a protein sequence and the quality of annotation\n\n# Prerequisites\n##### Knowledge / competencies\nThis course is designed for beginners and there are no requirements.\n##### Technical\nThis course will be streamed, you are thus required to have your own computer with an Internet connection.\n\n# Application\nThe registration fees for academics are **60 CHF** and **300 CHF** for for-profit companies.

In particular, these studies have made clear that the research data associated with a publication are fundamental to validate the published analyses and results. Many causes contribute to this lack of reproducibility in life science studies such as a lack of rigor in data management and analysis. This extensive problem related to improper research management has urged scientists to consider developing efficient Data Management Plans (DMP) for their research projects, a need that is also reflected in the requirements of funding agencies, amongst which the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNFS) and Horizon 2020. \n\nThis course, given by researchers and professionals involved in Big Data management at SIB/Vital-IT as well as in Data Management Plan preparation at UNIL/CHUV,  will provide you with effective support to produce high quality DMP complying with the guidelines established by funding agencies. Importantly, it will provide you with tools to generate robust data and excellent quality studies that are reproducible and reusable.\n\n*Sources of information*\n* Begley, C G, and Ioannidis, J.

You will learn best practices in Research Data Management (RDM) and especially two first steps concerning data collection and data documentation.

In particular, these studies have made clear that the research data associated with a publication are fundamental to validate the published analyses and results. Many causes contribute to this lack of reproducibility in life science studies such as a lack of rigor in data management and analysis. This extensive problem related to improper research management has urged scientists to consider developing efficient Data Management Plans (DMP) for their research projects, a need that is also reflected in the requirements of funding agencies, amongst which the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNFS) and Horizon 2020. \n\nThis course, given by researchers and professionals involved in Big Data management at SIB/Vital-IT as well as in Data Management Plan preparation at UNIL/CHUV,  will provide you with effective support to produce high quality DMP complying with the guidelines established by funding agencies.

This enables the discovery of tissue specific cell subpopulations and markers, and has revolutionized the way we can use gene expression data to answer biological questions. This 3-day course will cover the most-used technologies to generate scRNA-seq data, as well as the main aspects to consider while designing a scRNAseq experiment.

For example, contrasting different sample conditions i.e. disease vs. normal using scRNAseq can help identify sub-cellular differential behaviours and thus target specific gene markers. This 3-day course will cover the main technologies as well main aspects to consider while designing a scRNAseq experiment including a hands-on practical data analysis session applied to droplet-based methods.

Created by Linus Torvald and first released in 2005, Git has become\nthe de-facto standard for project source code management, and is extensively used both in open\nsource and commercial software development. The usage of Git is not limited to code development,\nbut can also be used to keep track of data analysis scripts and pipelines.\nThis 2.5 day course gives a very comprehensive introduction to Git and its most useful commands,\nas well as an introduction to collaborative workflows and to using GitHub. The last half-day of the\ncourse is optional.\n\n# Audience\nThis course is aimed at people with no or little knowledge of Git, who are interested in using\na version control system for collaborative work, or simply to keep track of modifications in their\nscripts/code base/files.\nThis includes people working on code development, but also scientists interested in improving the\nreproducibility of their data analyses by keeping track of their scripts using version control.\n\n# Learning objectives\nAt the end of the course, the participants are expected to have understood and practiced the following:\n\n* Introduction to Version Control Systems.\n* Basic Git concepts: commits, the HEAD pointer and the Git index.\n* Git branches: introduction to branched workflows and collaborative workflow examples.\n* Branch management: merge, rebase and cherry-pick.\n* Retrieving data from the Git database: git checkout.\n* Working with remotes: share your work and collaborate.\n* Basics of GitHub and GitLab.\n\n# Prerequisites\n### Knowledge/competencies:\nThe course is focused on using Git in command line mode (no graphical user interface).
